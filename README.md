IBM Watson Service: Watson Discovery News



## Abstract

Our team plans to make a webapp that given a search query, generates a dashboard of various political metrics via Watson Discovery News analytics.
e.g. Given a query "Trump", a dashboard will be populated off of the past 2 months of news articles. From this a user could choose a metric such as Positivity / Negativity to view a visualization representing this metric. The dashboard will also include revelant articles from the past 2 months, top terms that are related to this (i.e wordcloud), and a Biden vs Trump comparison. More widgets will be implemented as devised.
